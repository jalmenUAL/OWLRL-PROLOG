# OWLRL-PROLOG
OWL RL Reasoning with Prolog

This is a logic programming based implementation of the OWL 2 RL fragment. Prolog goals are used for querying, forward reasoning permits to infer new knowledge, and ontology inconsistency is handled by backward reasoning, where explanations and (minimal) justifications are given to inconsistent ontologies.
